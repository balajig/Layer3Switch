The SNMP Management Framework presently [Ed Note: Jan 2003]
consists of five major components:

*  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

* Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described
  in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and
  RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is
  described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
  RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

* Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
  first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
  is described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version
  of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet
  standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and is described in
  RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version
  of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and is described in
  RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

* Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
  first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
  described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
  protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
  RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

* A set of fundamental applications is described in RFC 2573
  [RFC2573].  The view-based access control mechanism is
  described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
